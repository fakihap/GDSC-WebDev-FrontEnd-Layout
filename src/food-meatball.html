                            <ol>
                                <li>Soak bread crumbs: In a large mixing bowl stir together bread crumbs and milk, then if needed add more milk 1 Tbsp at a time to moisten bread fully. Let rest while you chop ingredients (or at least 5 minutes).</li>
                                <li>Add ground meats and other meatball ingredients to mixing bowl: Add in beef, pork, eggs, onion, garlic, basil, parsley, oregano, parmesan and season over top of ingredients evenly with salt and pepper (I use 3/4 tsp salt if using jar sauce because it can be salty, and 1/2 tsp pepper).</li>
                                <li>Toss mixture by hand: Gently toss mixture and break meat up with fingertips until ingredients are evenly mixed.</li>
                                <li>Form into balls: Shape mixture with greased hands into evenly sides meatballs, about 1 1/4-inches each (or about (38g).</li>
                                <li>Rub the steak with a knob of butter - the sweetness from the butter will make it taste divine!</li>
                                <li>Or create a herb brush by tying woody herbs like thyme or rosemary to the handle of a wooden spoon and brush it over the steak every minute or so</li>
                                <li>Once cooked to your liking, rest the steak on a plate that can collect all the lovely juices for 2 minutes</li>
                                <li>Carve with a nice sharp carving knife, then serve with the resting juices drizzled on top</li>
