                            <ol>
                                <li>Form patties. Gently roll each mound into a ball (not firmly, we want tender patties not rock hard ones!) then press down into a patty that is slightly wider than the burger bun, to factor in cooking shrinkage.</li>
                                <li>Cast iron skillet – Preheat oil in a heavy-based cast iron skillet over high heat until it is very, very hot. Why a cast-iron skillet? Because it’s made for high heat fast cooking so we can get a great caramelised dark brown crust without overcooking the inside. This burger patty cooks in 3 minutes flat!</li>
                                <li>3-minute cook – Place 2 or 4 patties in the skillet (depending how many fit) and cook the first side for 1 1/2 minutes, pressing down LIGHTLY with a spatula. Note the emphasis on “lightly”! Nobody likes dense, hard patties where all the juice has been squeezed out during the cooking phase!</li>
                                <li>Trim the bread from all sides or you can keep it if you wish and apply butter on one bread, then apply the green chutney all over. Next, place the cucumber, tomato, onion slices over the bread slice along with the potato slice. Sprinkle salt over the veggies along with chaat masala. Lastly, add the grated cheese and cover this slice with the other slice.</li>
                                <li>Melted! And look at that. A perfectly cooked patty and melted cheese draped over it. A flawless burger!</li>
